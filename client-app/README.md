<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation and how to run the app

1. Clone the project to local
   
2. Open a new terminal, go to the client-app using the command below

cd client-app

3. Install dependency for the client side

npm i

4. Run the client side using the command below

npm start

## Features

1. The initial page will be the product detail page (in this case, the Classic Tee).
2. User will be able to choose the size of the current showing product, size options.
of each product will be listed as a clickable box.
3. User will be able to add 1 unit of current showing product to the shopping cart (for now 
user can only add 1 unit each time).
4. 'Add to cart' button only works when user selected a size.
5. Click on the 'My Cart' top right of the page to see shopping cart items, and click on the
'My Cart' again will hide the shopping cart.
6. Shopping cart items will be stored in localstorage (just for now; I suppose there will be a lot of issues in real projects of doing so), so cart items will not lose when refresh or restart.

Thank you for your time, have a wonderful day.
